Producing the Ionic liquid(s) to develop the multi-color ink/gel pen with the help of electronics to control the color changing.

1. Identifying the ionic liquid(s).
2. How we can colorize it by using the supplying the voltages as a difference to produce the multi-color.

Let say, the voltage difference is a driving force to change the color in a particular order and it can go for back and forth.

B       R     G      B       O       G
Black   Red   Green  Black   Orange  Gold
-------------------------------------------------------->
<-------------------------------------------------------
+ve                                                  +ve
?                                                      ?

3. Now, we have to control through a electronics to produce it.
4. Working temperature should be -- +50°c to 10°c.
5. Check for the solubility/viscosity, finally all physics.
6. Toxicological effect of Ionic Liquid.
7. Time lagging to build the color, so how you can control the running for handwriting.
   Let Say, for produce the color, we need +1ve and 4sec.
   So, can we increase the time to produce through more voltage supply?
If not, we can go for more selection or using the catalyst for that.
8. Running cost for the ionic liquid, how much we have to provide as a mAh and battery. So,finally how long we can use it.
9. Now, we have to create the barrels, for color producing liquids as a multi-color and how much we can write with one filling.
